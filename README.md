# language-systemverilog
SystemVerilog language support for Atom

## Progress
This project is still under development. It is coming soon.  
Because I am a front-end engineer and I only use SystemVerilog for hardware design, I know little about the syntax used in verification. Welcome to contribute. Both codes and test cases are OK!

## How to use it now?
It hasn't been upload to extension market yet. If you want to use it now, please download the whole repository, and upzip it at your Atom's extension directory. It will work like other extensions.
